    <img src="us tgt.jpg" height="600">  <h3> i remember when we took this photo, and i was teasing you and as i put my finger on your forehead and saw your smile i couldn't help but feel a wave of emotions hit me as ur beautiful smile and enchanting eyes just made me feel so happy. I want to make you smile like that and i want to treat you the way you should be treated. You're my girl and i want to be the best for you.</h3>
    <hr>
    <img src="her 1.jpg" height="600"> <h3>the first time i saw this photo i swear my pupils dilated a bit i was and still am enthralled by your beauty, your captivating eyes and the way ur hair sat on ur shoulders was just so perfect. Your tongue out looks so cute and silly i was so very elated when i first saw that photo.</h3>
    <hr>
    <img src="her 2.jpg" height="600"> <h3> your hair looks so damn amazing here, the way it just falls naturally on ur shoulders makes you seem heavenly, and yet again you look cute and mesmerising. I SWEAR my heart skipped a few beats the first time i saw this picture as i was in awe at your charm.</h3>
    <hr>
    <img src="her 3.jpg" height="600"> <h3> my eyes were in disbelief at the first glance of this picture, the radiant sun reflecting off your clear skin and the hair tied up nicely. Your dimples that ravel and intoxicating smile just makes this photo so perfect.</h3>
    <hr>
    <img src="her 4.jpg" height="600"> <h3> your voluminous curls just mesmerizes me everytime i look at this picture, and i often tilt my head horizontally to get a good look at you and then i realise how lucky i am to have you and that everyday is a blessing with you in my life. I find myself smiling everytime i look at this fascinating picture of my girl.</h3>


    <h3> i know this sounds crazy but everytime i look at you i fall for you even harder ü´∞ü´∞</h3>

    <h3> i know that our first date after India i made you feel so horrible and that i acted in an immature way and i am very sorry that i did all those things and i hope that you have the strength and courage to forgive me because as i am writing this with tears in my eyes i can't help but think of how lucky and i truly am to be able to have you. Your irresistible eyes, hypnotic scent, infectious laughter and your delicate and elegant voice are just a few of the qualities that you have that make me feel so comfortable and happy, these are the things that i once took for granted and didn't appreciate when i was supposed to, the things that i should've done for you on that date i didn't do and everyday regret and guilt just manifests in me as i never wanted to make you feel that way and even though i know i did i just wish that i could go back in time to change it, but i can't. Which is why i beg for your forgiveness as i want to treat you better, be the reason you smile, be the person that makes you feel the same comfort as i feel for you. Please forgive me. I will do everything i can to make sure i be the right man for you.</h3>
